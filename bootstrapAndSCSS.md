# Bootstrap exercise

## Task 1

Create a empty html-page and include bootstrap from CDN (content delivery network). Then edit the html to create a jumbotron.

## Task 2

Create a empty html-page and include bootstrap from cdn. Create a form on the page and make use of the standard bootstrap components for the form.
The form should allow the following information to be entered.

- Name
- Age (Numbers)
- Address
- Birthdate
- Selectbox with countries
- Favourite food (radiobuttons)
- Other things you think would be nice.

Standard components can be found on the following link: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/examples/

## Task 3

Re-create the previous tasks with SCSS: _look at the rendered Boostrap CSS from the previous task and try to make your own copy._
Is all that CSS needed or can we skip parts of it without sacrificing too much looks?

## Task 4

Using the images in canvas (the link is available in canvas; cats.zip), create a image carousel.
